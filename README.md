# Suicide in School Shootings

This project is based around the dataset that contains approximately 50 years of school shooting data, aquired by the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS). We will analyze this data by specifically looking at the variable suicide and the Yes and No columns. We will analyze whether there is a trend suicides over the years, and specifically suicides in specific age groups in the school shooters. For the purpose of this research, suicides will be defined by only the perpetrator. This project is to encourage additional resources and advocating for specific populations who may be at risk of shooting at a school and committing suicide. We also recognize this research should encourage further research into how suicide plays a role in school shootings.

## Files Structure
- .Rmd contains the R code and text to explain what is happening in each segment.
-  .rproj holds the files to load the raw code into R Studio. 
-  school_shooting_db_20200316.csv holds the data we utilized. This will need to be loaded into R to run the code.

## Usage
 - Open project in R Studio (or your choice of editor for R)
 - Open .rmd file containing the code with all tests and data. 
 - Run the first cell to load all required libraries. Uncomment the lines with "install.packages" to install the packages necessary if not already on device.
 - Run subsequent cells for each test that is carried out in the project. Each segment details which aspect of the paper the code is contributing too.

## Results
The results we encountered was that there was sufficient evidence to show that theres an increase in the raw number of suicides over the years. However, we do not have evidence to say the same for suicide percentage increase over time. Our last variable analyzed was age, and we found that older school shooters tend to commit suicide more often than younger school shooters.

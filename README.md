# Suicide in School Shootings

This project is based around the dataset that contains approximately 50 years of school shooting data, aquired by the Center for Homeland Defense and Security (CHDS) at the Naval Postgraduate School. We will analyze this data by specifically looking at the variable suicide and the Yes and No columns. We will analyze whether there is a trend suicides over the years, and specifically suicides in specific age groups in the school shooters. For the purpose of this research, suicides will be defined by only the perpetrator. This project is to encourage additional resources and advocating for specific populations who may be at risk of shooting at a school and committing suicide. We also recognize this research should encourage further research into how suicide plays a role in school shootings.

 - Open .rmd file containing the code with all tests and data. 
 - Run the first cell to install all required libraries. 
 - Run subsequent cells for each test that is carried out in the project.
